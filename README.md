The homework was challenging. HTML seems to be easier since you are just creating a shell for javaScrip to adjust. Know where to start on the .js doc is not well defined so I needed to breakdown the example as a wireframe to start addressing each element. Working out the functions to address all the questions, choices and answers then move to next in array was confusing. I'm having a challenge with javaScript and growing upon it.
